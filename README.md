# üß¨ UK Biobank OLINK Proteomics Analysis

This repository contains the code for **preprocessing**, **feature selection**, and **machine learning modelling** of the **UK Biobank OLINK proteomics** dataset.  
The analysis aims to identify predictive protein biomarkers related to Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### **`preprocessing/`**
Contains scripts for:
- Extraction and cleaning of **clinical and proteomic data**  
- Creation of **training and test sets**  
- **Variance partitioning analysis** of OLINK data  
- Preprocessing of OLINK data and correction for **confounders**

### **`Stats/`**
Contains statistical analysis scripts, including:
- **Cox regression** for survival analysis  
- **Mann‚ÄìWhitney U tests** on residualised data  
- **Matched analyses** controlling for age, sex, and confounders  
- Group comparisons between **PD**, **healthy controls (HC)**, and other **neurodegenerative disorders**

### **`Feature_selection/`**
Includes machine learning‚Äìbased feature selection methods:
